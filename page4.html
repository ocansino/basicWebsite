        <h2>
          Gaara vs Rock Lee
        </h2>

          After a long wait, Rock Lee is matched to fight against Gaara. Lee begins the fight by attacking with taijutsu, but his attacks are blocked by Gaara's Sand. To bypass the speed of Gaara's Shield of Sand, Might Guy allows Lee to remove his leg weights. In doing so, Lee's speed increases and he manages to land hits on Gaara, only to discover his body is coated in sand. Lee opens the first of the Eight Gates and launches Gaara into the air with several kicks. Catching Gaara with his bandages, Lee uses the Front Lotus on him, only to discover he used it on a Body Replacement Technique.

        <p>
          Lee's speed proved too much for Gaara, and his sand was no longer able to form a shield fast enough to be of use. Lee opened the Fifth Gate, and used his most powerful attack, Reverse Lotus. Gaara survived this final blow due to him softening his fall by turning his gourd into sand, and used the sand to crush Lee's left arm and leg. Gaara moved his sand to finish Lee, but Guy jumped in to protect his student. Lee, although unconscious due to the pain, rose to continue the battle, his desire to win fuelling his broken body. Guy wept at Lee's dedication, and Lee was taken away to recover. The medical ninja announced that Lee's injuries were too severe to be completely healed, and that he would never be able to fight as a ninja again. Guy regretted teaching Lee such dangerous techniques, and vacated the ring for the final match.

        <h2>
          Naruto vs Sasuke
        </h2>

          Angry that Naruto has continued to get stronger while he is still not strong enough to defeat his brother Itachi, Sasuke challenges Naruto to a fight. Activating his Cursed Seal, Sasuke used his enhanced speed and strength to overcome Naruto and strike him with a Chidori. Naruto managed to block the attack, but Sasuke, still intent on killing Naruto, tried to strangle Naruto, only to have himself thrown aside by a Nine-Tails-powered opponent. 
        </p>

        <p>
          With his enhanced abilities, Naruto was able to easily overwhelm Sasuke all the while trying to reason with him, only to have Sasuke ultimately reject his efforts. Despite this, Sasuke finally admitted they were fighting as equals. In this moment, Sasuke's Sharingan finally matured, enabling him to predict Naruto's movements and once again turn the tables. Upset by Naruto's persistence, Sasuke knocked him unconscious with Peregrine Falcon Drop. The Nine-Tails, probably to save itself, gave Naruto even more of its chakra, creating Naruto's one-tailed transformation, with the demon fox cloak that surrounds him. Naruto unleashed powerful attacks, which Sasuke was unable to keep up with.

          Feeling he had no choice, Sasuke increased his Cursed Seal of Heaven to Level Two, once again evening the playing field. Both Sasuke and Naruto realised the cost of their respective abilities at that point, but both decided that they had no other choice. Naruto created, using one hand, and the demon fox cloak's chakra as a shell, the Demon Fox Rasengan. Sasuke's Chidori, after a moment, warped into the Flapping Chidori. The two ninja collided their attacks; Sasuke, planning to punch Naruto in the heart, deliberately missed, and targeted the gut instead, while Naruto, referring to one of Sasuke's insults, scratched his forehead protector. A black dome of energy formed around them, which eventually dissipated, revealing the two ninja as their current forms, and then as their younger selves, who held hands and smiled at each other. When the dust settled, Sasuke was revealed to be victorious.
